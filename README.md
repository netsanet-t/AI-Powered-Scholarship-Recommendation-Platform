🎓 AI-Powered Scholarship Recommendation Platform

This project is an AI-driven scholarship recommendation system, co-developed with a partner. The platform helps students discover the most relevant scholarships by matching their profiles, academic background, and career interests against available opportunities using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

🚀 Features

AI-Powered Matching: Uses SentenceTransformers to generate semantic embeddings and recommend scholarships tailored to students.

Backend API: Built with FastAPI for high-performance, scalable endpoints.

Database Layer: Scholarships, student profiles, and matches are stored and managed with PostgreSQL.

Collaborative Development: Jointly developed — with contributions split across backend engineering, AI/ML modeling, and platform integration.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend Framework: FastAPI

AI / NLP: SentenceTransformers (BERT-based embeddings)

Database: PostgreSQL

Containerization (optional): Docker for deployment

Version Control: Git & GitHub

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-org/scholarship-recommender.git
cd scholarship-recommender


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  


Set up your PostgreSQL database and update .env file with:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/scholarships  


Run migrations (if using Alembic or similar).

Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload  

🔍 How It Works

A student fills in their profile & academic background.

The system encodes both student profiles and scholarship descriptions into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers.

Cosine similarity is used to rank scholarships against the student’s profile.

The API returns a personalized list of scholarships.

🤝 Co-Development Acknowledgment

This platform was co-developed with [Partner’s Name/Organization].

My Role: Backend development, AI matching pipeline (SentenceTransformers), and database integration with PostgreSQL.

Partner’s Role: [e.g., Frontend development, UI/UX design, and integration testing].

📈 Future Improvements

Add student dashboard for managing applications.

Expand AI model to support multilingual recommendations.

Incorporate ranking weights (financial need, deadlines, eligibility criteria).

Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
